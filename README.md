Components
1. IoT Devices
GAIA Basic MCU: The main microcontroller unit for data processing.

GAIA Basic Carrier Board: Interface for connecting sensors and modules.

GAIA LoRa Receiver: Enables long-range communication for data transmission.

2. External Sensors
Temperature and Humidity Sensor (DHT22): Monitors ambient temperature and humidity.

Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor (NextGen): Measures soil moisture levels.

Resistive Soil Moisture Sensor (GeoInnovators): Alternative soil moisture measurement.

3. Earth Observation (EO) Data
Website: Fetches weather data from online sources.

Satellite: Collects environmental parameters.

Collected Parameters: Includes temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and more.

Cloud Deployment
Data Reception: MQTT Broker
The MQTT broker receives data from IoT devices and stores it in a MySQL database. The system uses Python scripts to set up the MQTT broker and store sensor data.

IoT Database
The sensor data is stored in a MySQL database. The system uses Python scripts to fetch and display the data.

Earth Observation (EO) Data Acquisition
The system uses Earth observation data to predict rainfall. The following parameters are collected:

PRECTOTCORR: Total corrected precipitation (mm).

PS: Surface pressure (Pa).

RH2M: Relative humidity at 2 meters above ground level (%).

T2MDEW: Dew point temperature at 2 meters above ground level (°C).

T2M: Temperature at 2 meters above ground level (°C).

WS10M: Wind speed at 10 meters above ground level (m/s).

WD10M: Wind direction at 10 meters above ground level (degrees).

ALLSKY_SFC_SW_DWN: Downward shortwave radiation at the surface (W/m²).

The system fetches EO data from the NASA POWER API.

AI Model for Rain Prediction
The AI model predicts rainfall based on the collected data. The system uses a pre-trained model to make predictions.

Irrigation Scheduling Approach
The system operates as follows:

When IoT information arrives at the MQTT broker, it is stored in a MySQL database.

The AI model predicts whether it will rain the next day.

If rain is predicted, the system refrains from irrigating; if no rain is expected, the system proceeds with irrigation.

Irrigation commences at 6 AM, and the duration is determined by factors such as land surface area, desired soil depth, and flow rate of the electric valve.

Automation
The system is automated to run daily. A timer is set to repeat the process every day, ensuring consistent and efficient irrigation.

Conclusion
AquaSmart is a comprehensive solution for sustainable water management in agriculture. By integrating IoT sensors, AI models, and Earth observation data, it ensures efficient irrigation, leading to water conservation, increased crop yield, and cost efficiency.
